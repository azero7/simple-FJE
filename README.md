# simple-FJE
A simple tool to visualize JSON file in terminal. Supporting two style( tree &amp; rectangle) and 5 icon family( card &amp; king &amp; simple heart &amp; weather). 

Easy to extend the icon family by similarly writing whatever you want in the config.py.  

The format code for running the project is : fje -f <json file> -s <style> -i <icon family>.
